# kijiji_test
Front end developer test for Kijiji 

-first searched for a Kijiji api to be able to pull the data from to pass to my function, but learned that none existed. I then proceeded to create my own JSON data in order to test my functions and have something to render to my webpage. 


-install the masonry package manager npm install masonry-layout

-began small: included the listing data within the same JS file and as an array of objects. This initial data included listings that were perfect sqaures to start.
